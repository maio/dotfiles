;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a way to automatically trigger recompilation
;; when associated source buffer changes.

;;; Installation:

;; The easiest and preferred way to install recompile-on-save is to use
;; the package available on MELPA.
;;
;; Manual installation:
;;
;; Save recompile-on-save.el to a directory on your load-path (e.g.,
;; ~/.emacs.d/elisp), then add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;  (require 'recompile-on-save)
;;

;;; Using recompile-on-save:

;; You should have at least one source buffer and one compilation
;; buffer. When you run M-x recompile-on-save in the source buffer it
;; will ask you for a compilation buffer which you want to associate
;; with it. After that, each save of the source buffer will trigger
;; recompilation in the associated compilation buffer.
;;
;; To make this process even easier you might advice any compilation
;; function (e.g., compile) using recompile-on-save-advice.
;;
;; (recompile-on-save-advice compile)
;;
;; This way source <-> compilation buffer association will happen
;; automatically when you run M-x compile.
;;
;; To disable automatic recompilation run M-x stop-recompile-on-save
;;
